# DS-Viz: Data Structures Visualization

**DS-Viz** is a project designed to help learners explore and understand data structures in an interactive way. Each section of the project provides a unique, visually engaging way to interact with fundamental data structures, making complex concepts easier to grasp.

## Visualizations

### Sushi Game (Arrays)

This visualization uses a sushi conveyor belt analogy to demonstrate array operations. Users can add, remove, and manipulate elements in a way that visually represents how arrays function, including indexing elements.

### Matrix (Hash Tables)

The Matrix visualization represents a hash table as a grid structure, illustrating key hashing concepts like collision handling. Each cell acts as a slot in the hash table, showing how values are stored and retrieved.

### Graphs (In Progress)

Currently under construction, the graph visualization will help users explore graph-related concepts such as nodes, and edges.
